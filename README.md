# Welcome to the Computer Networks Projects Repository!

## Introduction

This repository is a hub for exploring the dynamic world of computer networks through hands-on coding projects. From client-server communication to file transfers, we delve into the realm of network programming using the versatile C language.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Calculator Application
In our inaugural project, we construct a robust calculator application where the client sends numerical operands along with desired operations to the server, which promptly responds with accurate results. Dive into the intricacies of client-server interaction while performing mathematical operations seamlessly.

### 2. File Transfer Mechanism
Our journey continues with a file transfer mechanism, where the client, by issuing the command "GET", can request files from the server. Witness the smooth exchange of data as files traverse the network, ensuring reliability and integrity throughout the process.

### 3. Enhanced Command-Line Functionality
Experience enhanced command-line functionality with the implementation of the "f" switch, enabling users to specify filenames for seamless retrieval. Discover how our system handles various scenarios, including file absence, ensuring informative responses for smooth user experience.

### 4. Exploring UDP Sockets
Delve into the world of User Datagram Protocol (UDP) sockets as we replicate previous functionalities, providing insights into the differences between TCP and UDP. Explore the nuances of reliable data transfer and understand the implications of packet loss on file integrity.

## Challenges and Considerations
While embarking on these projects, we encounter intriguing challenges and explore nuanced solutions. From handling end-of-file scenarios to mitigating packet loss risks, we delve into advanced techniques to ensure robustness and efficiency in our network applications.
